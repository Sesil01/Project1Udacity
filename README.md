## Installation<a name="installation"></a>
The code is executed using Python version 3.*. with several libraries and anaconda distributions to support it.

## Project Motivation<a name="Motivation"></a>
In this project, I want to know about the property type with the lowest review rating. Some of the questions I ask are:
1. Which property has the lowest review rating?
2. What about the prices on each property? Does the rental price of the property that has the lowest rating also have the lowest price?
3. From the lowest property data, which review is the lowest? What needs to be fixed?
The conclusion to be obtained is to find out what improvements need to be made by the owner of the type of property with the lowest review.
